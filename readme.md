# ‚öõÔ∏è React Process

Hi, thank you for applying to one of the React-based roles in our portfolio. We (Red Carpet) partner directly with hiring managers to deliver high-quality candidates for a priority process.

- We ü§Æ _despise_ the industry standard, adversarial, interview process. 
- This repostiroy servers as a means of our take on an inclusive, low-stakes but üí• high-impact approach to getting to the top of the stack of candidates at companies in our portfolio! 
- Instead of being 1 of a thousand resumes, put your best foot forward and be one of the few the Hiring Manager *actually cares about*.

Follow the `Getting Started` below and we'll reach out within 24 hours on next steps!

## üöÄ Getting Started

- There is absolutely, positively no time limit! That said, we expect the process 
should take no more than 30 - 45 minutes of your time.
- We _encourage_ you to work through the process at your own speed and provide thougtful insight, answers, and input.
- Please provide information and feedback in a fashion that you would be comfortable with your future co-workers, managers, etc, seeing.

### Set Up
This repository is a "Template Repository" which means you can make an exact copy of this repository within your github account. Please read through the three bullet points below **BEFORE** creating your own copy of this repo.

1. Click the `Use This Template` button found in the top right corner of the files list. 

2. Please name the repo `${company_name}_take_home`. In other words, if you're applying to "Amazing Co", name your version of this repo: `amazing_co_take_home`.

3. Ensure you have the visibility set to **Private**, otherwise the repo will be visible to the world! Github now allows for free private repos for all.

4. Ensure you have `Include all branches` checked. There is a branch which is needed later on to perform a Pull Requst review with.

That's all! Go ahead and get your repository going, then continue on to the **Instructions** below.

### Instructions
1. You can actually do everything below within github's webapp / editors the quick and easy way. However, if
   you'd like to do everything within your own environment, then feel free to Clone your fork of the repo locally.

2. Place your Resume, and any other files / resouces you'd like to pass along into the `/documents` directory

3. Open the `q_and_a.md` file and provide your insight to the questions included! These aren't technical questions in the traditional sense, and are more about the company, role, your cursiosities, and your interests!

4. Time to perform a quick PR review! Within the repository you created, there should be a branch named `feature/multiple-choice-question-component`.
Please make a pull request from that branch to the `main` branch and perform a code review on one of the two files included. 

5a. If you are familiar with Typescript, please do a code review of the `MultipleChoiceQuestion.tsx` file.

5b. If you are not familiar with Typescript, and are more familiar with Javascript,
perform a code review of the `MultipleChoiceQuestion.jsx` file. 

6. Leave the PR in review, do not merge it.


## üì´ Submission
- Please commit any changes you've made and make sure the `main` branch is up to date.
- Add the user `jaredpetker` (https://github.com/jaredpetker) as a collaborator.
- Feel free to email me at jared@redcarpet.dev if you'd like confirmation.
- That's it! We'll be in contact with you within 24 hours, if not the same day!
