# Q and A!

Please read through the company / role profile you've been provided, which should be
a `notion.so` web page that you received.

While reading through the profile, please consider what you find interesting about
Confident Cannabis, and why you believe you would be a fit for the role!

Let's get a few base parameters out of the way!

What is your name: Stephen Parker
If you have LinkedIn, what is your profile URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenparker-03/
If you have preferred pronouns, what are they: He/him

### 1. What do you find most interesting about the company and role?

- One of the things that I find really interesting about Confient Cannabis is that they're helping _simplify_ the process for a lot of these businesses. It's no secret that there's miles of red-tape when it comes to the industry as a whole, so any platform that makes it easier is a plus!
- Additionally, the role stood out to me because I love a good migration (i.e. the upgrade from Angular to React) that aims to optimize on the current codebase and UI.

### 2. Are you interested in the projects that you may be a part of? Why would you be a great fit for the projects?

- As I was talking about above, I'd love to help update an Angular codebase to React. I've been a pretty strict React/React Native convert for the last few years and I couldn't be happier with that stack. Sure, it's not going to solve _every_ problem that we throw at it, but there are a lot of ways to do things!
- I tend to be a "learner" - which is why music and software really hit a "note" with me overall. I'm always learning, and I love that software as a whole is an ever-expanding set of knowledge. You're never going to know everything, and you shouldn't strive to know _everything_.

### 3. What do you have not enough time to expore, but that you'd love to learn more about with respect to software, frameworks, languages, or your area of expertise? In other words, what are you currently curious about?

- I've had a strange love for Golang for awhile now! I've only started to scratch the surface of it but it's quite intriguing! My brain often tries to _Go_ (yep, I went there...) to that language when attempting to construct a backend if it needs good concurrency models.

### 4. What type of team environment are you looking for? What are your expectations of your peers and your manager?

- Generally, I'd love to be a part of team that has a lot of growth potential. I expect that if everyone is trying to grow with the product, and the team, then there's a general sense of "go get 'em" from a lot of your coworkers.
- Managers can come in all shapes and sizes! I don't necessarily look for one (or four) traits in general, but take each manager's experience and direction on its own mert.
